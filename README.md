# GitHub LabelSync for JIRA
Developed by our team at [Lerpal](https://lerpal.com/), this extension is designed to streamline the development workflow for both our team and our clients.

With the recent introduction of Insights in JIRA, we noticed that a similar existing extension is no longer functional. To address this, we have created a solution that seamlessly integrates with the updated JIRA environment. Our extension allows for adding information from GitHub pull request (PR) labels directly into JIRA tickets in sprint view. This allows teams to easily track the progress of PRs, identify who needs to take action next, and identify bottlenecks, ensuring a smoother, more efficient project management experience.

## Installation Instructions
After installing the extension, follow these steps to integrate it with GitHub:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
